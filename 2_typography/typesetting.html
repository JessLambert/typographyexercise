		In England, Edmund de Waal is a celebrated potter, known for installations of impeccably made vessels in soft shades of celadon or white, many of them permanently displayed in places like the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> here. But in the United States, Mr. de Waal is known primarily as a writer whose 2010 family memoir <span class="italic">“The Hare With Amber Eyes”</span> became a surprise best seller. Despite countless rejections from publishers, it ended up selling more than 1.5 million copies, has been translated into 26 languages and was recently optioned for a movie.
